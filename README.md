This project was a full stack application and utilized Express, JavaScript, and SPA for the frontend. On the back-end, a NoSQL MongoDB database was used.

<br />
JSON may be derived from JavaScript, however they are two completely different things. JSON is a formatting that is often used to store and transport data. One thing that had to be done in this project, in terms of refactoring, was changing the code to point towards the API. At first it was done locally, however this changed during the process of creating the web-application.
<br />
<br />
Another important thing that was done while creating this application was testing. We needed to do various tests to ensure that the web application had ample security and functioned properly. We checked for permissions required in order for users to access the API. We also made sure that the .env was in the gitignore so that passwords weren't leaked.

This course has been tremendously helpful in reaching my professional goals. This course was the most intensive that I have taken and was more comprehensive than others. It gave my not only experience with putting together the front end and back end of an application, but also with things like troubleshooting. This is important because no matter what type of application you're working on, these skills are all transferrable.
